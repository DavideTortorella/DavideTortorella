## **Projects** üç¨
- [**SnowIt - Marketing Analytics**](https://github.com/DavideTortorella/SnowIt-Marketing-Analytics): Working with real data provided by [**SnowIt**](https://snowit.ski/it/?srsltid=AfmBOorKlSRz0-kabkC7KcRvAteFehMMp2Hkybbt_IoWlOY1K76cvWT0), an Italian company offering services for amateur skiing activities, two marketing campaigns were designed, aimed at reducing customer churn. To achieve this goal, three techniques were mixed together: RFM analysis, a Machine Learning-based Churn propensity model, Sentiment Analysis through word embedding.
  
- [**Loan Approval Classification - Machine Learning**](https://hub.knime.com/davide_tortorel/spaces/Public/~zUEd55kZWrSfAa4L/): Project performed via the Knime Analytics Platform. Compared and trained various classification algorithms to label loan applicants as either risky (1) or not risky (0), based on their likelihood of repaying the loan.

- [**Regional Inequalities in Europe - Clustering**](https://github.com/DavideTortorella/European-Regional-Inequalities-Clustering): Clustering techniques, cohesion measures, and counterfactual analysis were applied to real data from the OECD Regional Well-Being dataset and Freedom House political freedom scores to address the following research question:
  *To what extent does there exist a gap between Eastern and Western Europe in terms of socio-economic conditions and political freedoms? An analysis based on clustering using income, employment, health, education, and political indicators.*
  
- [**Netflix - Data Visualization**](https://github.com/DavideTortorella/Netflix-DataVisualization): Exploratory data analysis performed on a Kaggle dataset to create an Interactive Dashboard. The goal was to provide advices to produce a "Successful Show". The audience is then a plausible Content-Maker.
